        industry: 'Software',
        turnover: '£3 million',
        employees: '10-50',
        intro: 'How GTIC helped a software company realise its R&D Tax Relief potential',
        background: `The company uses third party applications and software development kits to build bespoke solutions, 
                    reporting an annual turnover of £3m. The company thought it could not qualify for R&D Tax Relief due 
                    to the fact that it used off-the-shelf technologies.`,
        action: `GTIC found the company developed integration modules not available from third parties. The company also 
                 developed solutions to overcome limitations in software development kits. Working closely with the software 
                 development team, GTIC identified a series of middleware developments.`,
        result: `Successful R&D claim, claiming back more than £150,000 over the previous two years.`

        turnover: '£2.5 million',
        employees: '10-50',
        intro: 'How GTIC helped an oil & gas firm secure a substantial retrospective R&D Tax Relief claim',
        background: `The company designs and develops plant and machinery to provide oil & gas well intervention and testing 
                     services, reporting an annual turnover of £2.5m.`,
        action: `Although the company had been operating since 2000, it had not been informed of the R&D incentive as the 
                 accountants were unable to technically assess the company's activities. GTIC identified eligible activities, 
                 set up project capturing tools and implemented an innovation incentive strategy.`,
        result: `Successful R&D claim, claiming back £200,000 over two years.`

        turnover: '£5 million',
        employees: '51-100',
        intro: 'How GTIC helped a packaging manufacturer maximise the value of its R&D Tax Relief strategy',
        background: `The company designs and develops packaging for a variety of household products, and has successfully 
                     claimed R&D Tax Relief in the past.`,
        action: `GTIC found only new products were being included in the company's claims and revisited the definition of R&D 
                 with department directors. GTIC identified further opportunities in projects that overcame limitations in 
                 materials due to sustainability and environmental factors. These projects duplicated the existing effects of 
                 existing products, while consuming less resource.`,
        result: `Increased the amount of expenditure qualifying for R&D Tax Relief by £300,000.`
