                        <p>We arrange an introductory phone call to discuss your business and the type of work that you undertake. 
                            This helps us to ascertain whether your projects or initiatives qualify for R&D Tax Relief. If your 
                            business is eligible, we will send you an engagement agreement and enrol you onto a workshop.</p>

                        <p>This is where we dive into the detail behind your project. Discussions with your project managers, engineers 
                            and product owners about your project goals and the approach taken will help us to further scope out the 
                            work involved and pinpoint the specific areas where relief can be claimed.</p>
                        <p>At the end of this stage, we will have enough information to write the technical narrative of your claim

                        <p>Having collected documents such as your company accounts and tax returns, we conduct an expenditure analysis 
                            to calculate the available R&D Tax Relief benefit. This is where you find out the eligible costs and discover

                        <p>Upon your approval, we file your completed claim report with HMRC, and either incorporate the R&D Tax Relief 
                            calculation into your Corporation Tax return or assist your accountant in doing so.</p>
                        <p>Our claim reports far exceed the compliance standards expected by HMRC, so the risk of an enquiry is minimal. 
                            However, in the unlikely event that the taxman conducts a compliance check, we will exercise our experience 
                            of closing down enquiries at no extra cost.</p>
