                            This helps us to ascertain whether your projects or initiatives qualify for R&D Tax Relief. If your

                        <p>Our claim reports far exceed the compliance standards expected by HMRC, so the risk of an enquiry is minimal. 
                            However, in the unlikely event that the taxman conducts a compliance check, we will exercise our experience 
                            of closing down enquiries at no extra cost.</p>
