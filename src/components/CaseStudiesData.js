                    The company thought it could not qualify for R&D Tax Relief due to the fact that it used off-the-shelf 
                    technologies.`,

                 company also developed solutions to overcome limitations in software development kits. GTIC identified a

                 set up project capturing tools and implemented an innovation incentive strategy.`,

                 being included in the claims and revisited the definition of R&D with department directors.
                 GTIC identified further opportunities in projects that overcame limitations in materials due to sustainability

                 consuming less resource.`,
